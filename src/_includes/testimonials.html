        "I would highly recommend Case Design/Remodeling for any project. They created a beautiful design for our kitchen and great room area, working around some unusual existing architecture. The design and budgeting process was straightforward and collaborative, including the material selection process. Case recommended excellent vendors for the appliances, plumbing, and lighting, and coordinated deliveries with those vendors. The build progressed on schedule with friendly and talented carpenters and tradespeople. The team minimized the disruption to the rest of our home and left the work site clean and neat every evening. Our lead carpenter, Drew Davis, was super-friendly, very creative, and highly skilled. He came up with creative “fixes” and workarounds and included us in detailed design decisions while doing the finish carpentry and cabinet setup. This was the largest remodel project we had ever undertaken and Case was a reliable and skilled partner throughout. We are thrilled with the results – the kitchen and great room are beautiful and really work for our lifestyle."
